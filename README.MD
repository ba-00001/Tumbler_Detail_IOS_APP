# Project 6 - Tumbler Detail Viewer

Submitted by: **BRIAN BAZURTO**

**Tumbler Detail Viewer** is an app that allows users to view detailed information about posts from the Tumbler feed. By tapping on a blog post in the main feed, users can navigate to a detailed view where they can see the post's image and read its caption.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Setup navigation to the Detail Screen
- [x] Created the Detail View UI
- [x] Add the ability to pass data to the Detail View Controller
- [x] Made personal finishing touches to the UI

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Utilize `Nuke` for efficient image loading and caching.
- [ ] Implemented HTML tag stripping for cleaner caption text display.
- [ ] Custom animations for transitioning between the Feed and Detail View.
- [ ] Dynamic resizing of text view based on content size for an improved user experience.

## Notes

One challenge was ensuring smooth data passing between the Feed and Detail View Controllers, especially when dealing with asynchronous image loading. Another hurdle was dynamically resizing the text view based on the length of the post's caption to ensure a clean UI.
